# The Minecraft Monitor

The minecraft-monitor was created as a small, lightweight web-app that I could
run alongside my Minecraft Server to give my basic visibility and control over
the everyday things so I wouldn't have to ssh onto my server all the time to
start it, stop it, update settings, add people onto the whitelist and so on.

It's not meant to be sophisticated or pretty, just functional.
