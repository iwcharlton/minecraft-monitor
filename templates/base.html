{# ``base.html`` is the template all our other templates derive from. While
  Flask-Bootstrap ships with its own base, it is good form to create a custom
  one for our app, as it allows customizing some aspects.

  Deriving from bootstap/base.html gives us a basic page scaffoling.

        <p>The Minecraft Monitor</p>
        <p style="font-size: small;">&copy; Iain Charlton</p>
        <p style="font-size: small;">The minecraft-monitor was created as a small, lightweight web-app that I could run alongside my Minecraft Server
        to give my basic visibility and control over the everyday things so I wouldn't have to ssh onto my server all the time to start it,
      stop it, update settings, add people onto the whitelist and so on. It's not meant to be sophisticated or pretty, just functional.</p>
